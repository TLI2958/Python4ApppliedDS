# Python4ApppliedDS
The  repository contains assignments and materials from the UMich specialization AppliedDSwithPython on Coursera

Previous to taking this course, I had had only some exposure to Python 
via some courses from another specialization Python 4 
Everyone. So, unfortunately, my response to the assignment 
would be bound by my experience (or inexperience).

Comments and Feedback are more than welcome. 

Hope you find it useful.
