# Python4ApppliedDS
The  repository contains assignments and materials from the UMich specialization Python4AppliedDS on Coursera

Previous to taking this course, I had had only some exposure to Python 
via some courses from another specialization Python 4 
Everyone. So, unfortunately, my response to the assignment 
would be bound by my experience (or inexperience).
